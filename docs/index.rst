Welcome to repobee-plug's documentation!
========================================

``repobee-plug`` is a package for creating plugins for `RepoBee
<https://github.com/repobee/repobee>`_. While the plugin system itself is
implemented in the core application, this package contains every part necessary
to actually create a plugin. If you just want to use plugins created by others,
then you're in the wrong place and should head over to `the RepoBee User Guide
<https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins.html>`_. If you want to create
plugins, you are in precisely the right place! I recommend you read through all
of the general documentation, and then refer to the parts of the module
reference that you need for your plugin.

Don't hesitate to get in touch if you need help, you can use the `issue tracker
<https://github.com/repobee/repobee-plug>`_ or find `contact details on the
official web site <https://repobee.org/contact.html>`_.
